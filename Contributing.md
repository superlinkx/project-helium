# Areas in Need #
The main areas in need of help are the following:

  * Graphics - A better graphics strategy is needed (new icons, new sprites, new logos, new backgrounds, etc.)
  * Audio - Sound effects and background music are needed. Also, the HTML5 implementation of said sound needs work.
  * Code - The engine needs to be cleaned up and more features added.
  * Code - The overall game needs an overhaul to be more user-friendly and a better design.
  * Documentation - Better documentation is needed.
